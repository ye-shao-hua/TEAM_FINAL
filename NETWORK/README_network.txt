This is our capacitance solver, 
which is used by passing an input file and an output file to the solver program, 
and the program will automatically read and parse the input file and write the result of the calculation to the output file, 
as shown in the "-h" parameter. 

"/NETWORK/src" is used to store all the source files.
"/NETWORK/bin" directory to store executable files. 
"/NETWORK/Cases" stores the data provided by the Matchmaker.
"/NETWORK/etc" stores the open source libraries used.
"/NETWORK/include" holds our header files.
"/NETWORK/lib" holds our static link library (".a" file).
"/NETWORK/res" is our network moldel.
"/NETWORK/result" is used to store the result file of each input file.
"/NETWORK/tmp" is used to store all ".o" files
